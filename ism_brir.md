# Binaural room response from Image source model

<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/BorisJung/ISM_BRIR_Demo#image-source-model-binaural-room-impulse-response-script">View GitHub Repository</a>



This script was developed as part of a portfolio exam during my master's studies at TU Berlin. It requires the Auditory Modeling Toolbox, the Large Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox as well as the SOFA MatLab API included in the corresponding subfolder.

Once all set up, it calculates the binaural room impulse response of a rectangular room with parameters given by input variables. See pictures subfolder or [``project_paper.pdf``](https://github.com/BorisJung/ISM_BRIR_Demo/blob/master/project_paper.pdf?raw=true) for an overview of the functionality.
