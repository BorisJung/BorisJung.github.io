# Evaluation of general purpose digital potentiometers

<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/BorisJung/digiPots">View GitHub Repository</a>

Since I've encountered and actually have debugged circuits that used digital potentiometers but never really used them in a design myself, I wanted to start a simple evaluation of cheap general purpose models, which shall be logged here. 

The first practical application will be using a digital potentiometer to replace the 10V-pwm circuitry, which I'm currently using to dim some LED fixtures using a MeanWell powersupply with 3-in-1 dimming function. (see page 4 in [HLG-40H-20-B datasheets](https://www.meanwell-web.com/content/files/pdfs/productPdfs/MW/HLG-40H/HLG-40H-spec.pdf))

This would save me the 10V supply, physical space as well as unnecessarily wasted energy (although admittedly not very much).


### First eval boards

The first steps were taken with 2 different cheap general purpose digital potentiometers mounted on [multi-package breakout-boards](https://www.digikey.de/product-detail/en/adafruit-industries-llc/1212/1528-1071-ND/5022800) as depicted in Figure 1.

The two potentiometers currently under evaluation are: 

- Texas Instruments TPL0501 ([Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpl0501-100.pdf?ts=1594580841545))
- Microchip MCP4141 ([Datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22059b.pdf))

Both have a nominal value of 100kÎ© and can be controlled via [SPI interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface). The MCP4141 comes in a MSOP8 package, so it was easily mounted. Since a SOT23-8 wasn't easily available, I mounted the TPL0501 on the MSOP8 breakout board as well, which was feasible for evaluation purposes, should not be attempted for the final application, due to additional mechanic stresses of the solder joints.

In the final LED-dimming application mentioned above, the will be controlled by a raspberry pi zero w. For developing purposes however, an [Adafruit FT232H Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264), which allows communication between USB hosts and various interfaces (SPI, I2C, UART), was used. 


### First test script

Tests with the TPL0501 using the following simple python script were succesful:

```
import time

from board import *
import busio
import digitalio

from adafruit_bus_device.spi_device import SPIDevice

with busio.SPI(SCK, MOSI, MISO) as spi_bus:
    cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(D4)
    device = SPIDevice(spi_bus, cs)

    # temp. helper variables
    ba_full = bytearray([255])
    ba_zero = bytearray([0])
    print(ba_zero)
    print(ba_full)

    # Write Transaction
    with device as spi:
        print('switch to zero')
        cs.value=False
        spi.write(bytearray(1))
        cs.value = True
        time.sleep(1)
        print('switch to max resistance')
        cs.value = False
        spi.write(ba_full)
        cs.value = True
```

### Next steps

- writing a simple python driver for the TPL0501 to easily implement in python scripts
- testing MCP4141 with simple script
- writing a driver for MCP4141
- selecting, ordering and evaluating multichannel general purpose digital potentiometers
- selecting, ordering and evaluating precision digital potentiometers
