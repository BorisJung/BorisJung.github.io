# Channel Strip

<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/BorisJung/channelStrip#Overview">View GitHub Repository</a>

During my bachelor's studies, this channel strip was developed for the "Project Lab" course at HTW Berlin.

Although there are many beginner's mistakes, especially regarding the layout, 


This project was the result of a semester project during my bachelor's studies.
